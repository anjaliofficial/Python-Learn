#Break  in python 

# Loops in Python can be controlled using jump statements like break. These statements allow you to change the flow of execution by exiting loops prematurely or skipping iterations.

# The break statement specifically is used to terminate the loop when a certain condition is met, allowing the program to continue executing the code that follows the loop.
